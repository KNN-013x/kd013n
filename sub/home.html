                        it's daski's first birthday! uh, not really, but she unexpectedly knocked on our doors one fateful morning. afaik it was around 8am as i was just finishing some stuff, 'bout to sleep after an allnighter, then mama (my grandma) yelled at me to fetch this kitty. literally the cutest feller ive ever seen! not much is known about her, and i like that to stay as it is. all i know at that time is that she's from mama's friend, probably halfbred siamese and pusakal (from tagalog: [cat = "pusa"] + [street = "kalye"] = [streetcat = "pusakal" is a diminutive of "pusang kalye"])
