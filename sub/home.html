                            <span class="a">uh i still dont know exactly what to do with this shit, but it's mainly for me to remember how front-end webdev :puke: works. i hate webdev, but putting something i created in the web seems pretty cool (no matter how useless it is, and how it literally consumes energy inside github's servers). so yes, there isnt really anything to expect here but typos, bugs, and things i want to share with friends and strangers-alike</span><br><br>
                            <span class="q">so, a blog it is?</span><br>
                            <span class="a">no. i have other plans. well, ok, partly correct! maybe 25% bloggy stuff</span><br><br>
                            <span class="q">this thing is an eyesore.</span><br>
                            <span class="a">ok, that isnt even a question, but ive already anticipated that one :P this is supposed to look blocky atm, simply bc i lack creativity. i dont know a thing about design, so the color scheme would be really bad (for now?). as much as possible, i dont want this to look corporate and bootstrappy (ie the webdesign format for most sites these days). bring back the golden age of badass site designs! like, check <a href="https://youtu.be/BGEft8rnSHY">these</a> out</span>

                            it's buda's first birthday! i actually have no clue when she was born, and we were "forced" to adopt her. afaik it was around 8am as i was just finishing some stuff, about to sleep after an allnighter, then mama yelled at me from outside to fetch this kitty. surprised about the entire thing, but it literally is the cutest feller ive ever seen so theres no way im rejecting this one! not much is known about her, and i like that to stay as it is. oOoOh mysterious! all i know at that time is that she's from mama's friend, probably halfbred siamese and pusakal*

                            *etymology: from ["pusa" meaning cat] + ["kalye" meaning street] = ["pusa-kal" a diminutive of "pusang kalye"]. pusakal isnt a breed but it's a convenient term to refer to unknown shorthair cat breeds)

                            i dont know what struck me last May 18th, but i suddenly wanted to procrastinate by designing this awful mess. i hate webdev so please bear with me... i still cant center a div. depending on my progress, the links on the left may or may not take you where it's supposed to <br><br>

                            edit (29/06/22): css flex/grid is the answer for all alignment problems
