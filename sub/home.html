                            hi! it's been quite a while :) i came back here because i plan to write more journal entries. yeah, so i just added a new one! also planning to transfer my microproject here that randomizes rym wishlist entries, but i still gotta convert it from py to js... and i dont do javascript :') also planning to update the code for this site because the px units stress me out!! oh gof, the code and the layout really is a fucking mess. i do not know what got into me for choosing pinks for the color scheme (turns out ate kim was right all along?) aaaaa! we'll get there, we'll get there :)

                            it's buda's first birthday! i actually have no clue when she was born, and we were "forced" to adopt her. afaik it was around 8am as i was just finishing some stuff, about to sleep after an allnighter, then mama yelled at me from outside to fetch this kitty. surprised about the entire thing, but it literally is the cutest feller ive ever seen so theres no way im rejecting this one! not much is known about her, and i like that to stay as it is. oOoOh mysterious! all i know at that time is that she's from mama's friend, probably halfbred siamese and pusakal*

                            *etymology: from ["pusa" meaning cat] + ["kalye" meaning street] = ["pusa-kal" a diminutive of "pusang kalye"]. pusakal isnt a breed but it's a convenient term to refer to unknown shorthair cat breeds)
