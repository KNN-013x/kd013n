        it feels like time moves so fast and so slow at the same time. last saturday morning, i had to convince myself to sleep but it was until 3am when i actually forced my eyes shut. had this 7:45 alarm set up to wake me ideally around that time, but i remembered turning it off. but yeah, i had this dream where i was in a convenience store (cuz i was supposed to do a quick run to the store to get some ribbon pasta) where i was asked to look for a peach soda. in that dream, the store morphed into different versions as i passed through aisles, and it felt like forever as i was trying to look for it. YES, there were aisles upon aisles of soda and none of them was peach flavored or anything remotely resembling it. the dream ended when i got into the cashier then everything started to look dark, and some weird antique dresser appears instead of the soda fridge. someone opened it and inside was this gothic castle. i was super creeped out then all of a sudden this guy spoke with this tour guide spiel about romanian castles and my phone rang once again. every morning, my phone quizzes me with this 'left logo vs right logo: which one is the snooze button' and im guessing my success rate should be below 20%. oh so yeah i noticed that it's only 7:47 but fuck that felt like no less than an hour... i really took that peach soda quest seriously!! well anyways, it's weird how perception really changes everything, especially with something as constant as time. oh with constant, i meant that it's running in constant intervals, 60 seconds: 1 minute, 1000 milliseconds: 1 second. or is it? maybe physics has a very elaborate objection to this 'constantness' that occurs under specific conditions and is not usually applicable with my mundane activities. or probably theyd argue that the metric itself is not aligned with all possible conditions so it's not 100% accurate or reliable but yeah whatever. well at least we've considered these speculations so yeah pedantry is banned for the moment. going back, i was on an exam later that day and it felt like time just went craaazy fast

        there are a lot of factors that could contibute to the subjectivity of perception. could be emotions, levels of stress, neurochemistry, and a whole lot of physical/nonphysical factors. it's almost scary thinking about how susceptible i am with changes in my environment, which in turn shapes my perception/behavior towards certain things at a given point in time. well, to be fair you shouldnt really hyperanalyze on things in a micro-fied scale if what youre seeking to achieve is immediate proactivity. i was seriously thinking of how attention or levels of stress probably contributes this changing perception of time... like i even wrote THIS. and oh god, i am not gonna write about some other things iwas thinking about as i was writing this. side note: it's crazy how so many things can occupy your mind simultaneously. i am not at all suprised by how our minds can simulate dream worlds and whole entire scripts for randomly-generated people without letting your main character know anything about the 'storyline' or the setting unless they investigate it themselves. oh yeah, as i was saying, too much analysis brings forth too much theories which require too much investigation that would definitely take too much experiments and ultimately too much wasted time for literally nothing. ayo, this makes scientists seem like madmen. i mean really, i experienced a bit of research struggle back in my highschool and the testing period is rather traumatizing cuz there's always this risk that all youve worked for is insufficient/downright wrong. it's worse because youre working in a very limited timeframe and your shit really has to be grounded in previously tested out/worked upon findings and theories so youre not just blindly going along the process. and even if you think your background and methodology seems legit, your mind still has a choice to overinflate that anxiety, doesnt it? oh well, then goes compiling all your previous papers to get a decent looking manuscript which will be published along with other studies. fuck what i thought was something that i just needed to get through actually already has a seat reserved for a legacy of tangible humiliation

        this was just meant to be a quick rant about how time sucks and i wish i could pause it anytime. yeah pause is good, no more extra options. id just love to take a break sometimes because time moves wayyyy too fast. ykw, someone recommended me journalling a few years back. i never considered it because i do not have a good handwriting nor do i have a good writing style. but this is actually pretty cool. it's a good substitute for a conversation cuz it's less scarier. conversations can certainly be awesome but my mind always just goes mjdbsksnfGYUHkmjgwsyfghe fkcjrtm2hJGHMDJKSFG3U8Y5 b523554btHN4!!! when it shouldnt be :( it really does suck when i know that the person is actually pretty cool and chill but i cant be uhh chill? see?! just talking about it makes me un-chill and all sdjhnsgfhusdhngusrhefdkughreju. oh god

        whew, thanks for sitting through. i admire your dedication for listening to me ramble about basically nothing. this isnt fun. let's do it again next time
