            The Philippine history up to the late 19th century was interpreted under two differing axes of thought: Bipartite and Tripartite views. The Bipartite view was endorsed by the Spaniards as Philippine history was divided into two periods, that which of periods of darkness and enlightenment, revolving around the focal premise of the absence and presence of Catholic faith amongst the natives. The Illustrados, a group consists of the educated class of Filipinos during the Spanish colonial period, however, advocated a Tripartite view of the Philippine history. The heart of the proposed Tripartite view lies on the presence and absence of progress and national growth, in contrast to Catholic faith. This matter of progress has been a subject of dissent amongst the Illustrados, especially as the three key figures of the movement have differing interpretations of this said view.

            Regarding the difference of opinion between Graciano Lopez Jaena, Marcelo H. del Pilar, and Jose P. Rizal, the key figures of the Illustrados, I express my personal inclination towards who I believe had the most compatible views considering the general condition of the Philippine nation at that given period. I find the views of Marcelo H. del Pilar more grounded with the economic and political context of progress, which is a strong guiding principle in governance. For a country that has been socially and psychologically manipulated for centuries through colonization, I argue that building a foundation on economic control and governance is the first step to our actualization as a nation. The precolonial history of the Philippines has existing documentations, but these accounts of burgeoning international trade and prosperous polities are only indicative of the dynamics existing in those particular regions and polities. The romanticized image of precolonial Philippines is not sufficient to create a national identity out of. Based on the geography of our nation itself, the existence of different societies is very probable, as regional separation is an integral factor that influence culture and regional identity. Identity, I believe, for such colonized nation like the Philippines is a fragmented aspect, and it is unstable to build a nationalistic ideal from it.

            The mother-and-daughter analogy presented by del Pilar is based on the blood pact between Legaspi and Sikatuna, and it serves as the start of the enlightenment period of precolonial society. For him, it was the symbol of progress, which is driven by duty: that is for Spain to help the Philippines. This task was first entrusted to the encomenderos, but the economic growth colonial era has declined due to the transfer power to the friars and the establishment of frailocracia. This shift, as he described, has been consistent with the laws of history, as societal evolutions occur and the interests of the Spaniards are no longer compatible with the progress of the Philippine nation. I agree that the frailocracia is a defective system that hindered progress for the Filipinos as their governance is intrinsically entangled with their religious leanings, as opposed to governing Filipinos under the grounds of economic like the encomenderos' governance.

            At this period, it would be greatly beneficial for Philippine economy to seek help to implement liberal reforms with the help of Spanish liberals. Philippines has proved itself as a strategic advantage when it comes to international trade, and support from the Spain would be beneficial for Filipinos to participate in trade under a liberal rule without the control of the friars. The fortification of a strong national identity, I believe is tied with our capacity to produce and participate in our nation’s own progress. Spain, in this context, would be but a catalyst for the Filipinos to fully realize their capacities and hopes for a better future. Del Pilar’s view alludes on the parental analogy that he used, and following that logic, a period would also come when the Philippines, ideally, forms its own identity and becomes self-sufficient.
