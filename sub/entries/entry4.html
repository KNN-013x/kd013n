        among a few other things that bother me right now, one of those is this confusion regarding history. the history of where i came from. we have this course about rizal, taught by this prof with a background in history and oh god it's driving me nuts. just recently, we had these general education courses that only seem to conspire towards this single goal of igniting nationalism in our minds. i am not very familiar of the western definition of nationalism, but i think our definition does not lean towards the fascistic kind

        <br><br>

        as far as my memory serves, the philippines under the context of a unified nation is non existent before the spanish conquest. many documents and artifacts prove the existence of polities and societies. those who were situated in coastal areas were said to be prosperous and were centers of international trade. i am confident that i know very little regarding the precolonial philippines, and i am in no position to assume anything. but oh well, for the sake of completing a two-page homework in less than an hour, i had to bullshit my way into coming up with this conclusion that del pilar's tripartite view is something that i agree with. in reality, i dont know... i couldnt agree with any of them because i do not have a sufficient understanding of any of precolonial history. ugh, anyways, i hope my work will fill you in as to what 'tripartite view' is. heres my <a href="entry4_a1.html" target="_blank">essay</a>, please dont mind the grammatical errors for i had no time to correct them :')) fuuuuck, do i feel INCREDIBLY uneasy about agreeing with that mother-and-child analogy. i know, it does fit in that economic context, which i used to gaslight myself into completing this horrendous shit. anyways, it just wouldnt feel right to say these things, especially when you have been raised all your life to hate the spaniards. i only know a very little percentage of the atrocities that theyve committed for three hundred and thirty three years, but it is enough to instill this sense of hate towards them deep beneath my heart. it sounds weird, does it? the media, the education system, all of our teachers painted the spanish, american, and japanese conquest under this grim light; centuries filled with violence, exploitation, and death for essentially nothing but their self interests. heh, our history does make for a compelling plot, and that's exactly what kept the hate growing for years: it happened. as a filipino, i feel like a torchbearer whose responsibility is to take this flame to the next generations to keep this sense of nationalism alive

        <br><br>

        did you catch that? a thing that keeps our nationalism alive is hate. is this incredibly strong yearning for justice. but nobody would give us that. all these people who committed these atrocities are already long dead, and so are our ancestors. i could not hate their descendants nor could i hate their country. as much as history should not be forgotten, this complex feeling brought by hate, helplessness, and injustice is carried by the stories of our past. just questions upon questions of why. what did we ever do to deserve that?

        <br><br>

        remember when i said that we werent a unified nation then? our geography alone would tell you how painfully accurate that is. even living here in present-day philippines would tell you how diverse this place is. where were we supposed to get that shared vision of a unified nation? we did not have the chance to find that. i mean, it is normal in a society to have distinction of opinions or whatnot. but i know, i just know that a strong understanding of a national identity is necessary for all the citizens to fully recognize their worth in a society and work towards achieving shared goals. i am sorry for phasing it in such a textbookesque way, but god, YES it DOES matter. national identity matters, and thats what i see is present with all these countries that seem to be doing amazing. this place feels like very fragmented, so broken. you can see it everywhere, but everyone is just too busy to do whatever they can to survive. this strong sense of survivalism and dreams of a better future seems to be the only thing that keeps this place afloat. what it seems to me is that the present-day philippines is just a consequence of individual efforts towards personal goals. and everywhere you look is just disorder and mess, but funnily enough, people are just doing whatever they can to navigate this mess. manila, for example, might just be the absolute hell for anyone who is used to function under orderly systems. i have no idea why systemic reform is not happening, but by the looks of it, reform is very complex: especially if youre trying to achieve it while minimizing as much disruption as possible. you cannot just disrupt a 'system' THAT HAPPENS TO work, especially if theres already a whole lot that's stacked on it. any disruptions in that busy network can cause catastrophic consequences. can you visualize it? heh, tahts just how i see it though, in a more detached and theoretical manner sort of. but it does feel right to me. yeah, we kinda missed the trial-and-error process of building a nation, courtesy of our colonizers! and now we're forced to ride the waves of globalization :(

        <br><br>

        ughhhh, i sure am aware that i am missing many key pieces here, and many of my conclusions can be wrong. this is what's driving me nuts! i feel like i would never know the answer even if you give me another 50 years to figure it out. just like what i have described, i, too, have to participate in this system! i havent even gotten myself to what the dub 'the real world' yet, and that shit scares me to death. well, anyways thanks for sitting by. i initially wrote this to mellow down that feeling of confusion regarding philippine history, and im glad that it worked out in the end. now im just thinking of scary mundane things again. oh, and yeah, that history major prof is amazing like holy guacamole. he made us write these think pieces that kinda takes us to a simulation where we're back in 'those' times. oh, i meant, it's like we're forming these analyses of social problems as if theyre still relevant. i just bullshitted my way towards those pieces because my brain chemistry wants me to do them under an hour no matter how long i sit in front of my computer. but hey, i really meant those things that i wrote, at least with my limited knowledge at those times. oh, and yeah, he isnt trying to instill the readings that he provided as infallible facts. it's amazing, we had the chance to think beyond the material provided, and of course, look for other sources that could substantiate our opinions. maybe, one time in the future, i might revisit this again. holy hell, social sciences have never been my strength... same with languages. but yeah i am writing. i dont know why, but it feels good sometimes
