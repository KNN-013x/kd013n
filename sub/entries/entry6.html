<br><br>

i do not know what has gone into me, but i sent a person who i 'ghosted' a mail apologizing for taking almost a year to hear from me again lol. anyways, as expected, they werent pleased with it. perhaps theyre thinking that im insulting their intelligence by reducing it to 'me being terrible at keeping track of messages', heh. but yeah, it's pretty upsetting in combination with this other related thing that im about to touch on shortly. just a brief storytime, exactly a year and a day ago, my dad got back home from working overseas. things happened and it was a very tough time for me. as a bonus, theres this one uni course that i essentially flunked because i wasnt able to submit all the requirements at time. to be fair, the course is a general educ course that touches on philo and psych. lots of the requirements there were involved assessing your personal philosophy and shit, which i took SERIOUSLY. everything that couldve gone wrong at that time just... went wrong. i was way too depressed to even consider the only rational solution of 'fixing it' before 2023 comes and i just sulked on this fucking feeling, hoping that i could get the courage one day to just end it all. so i did absolutely nothing :) it's just the fucking miserable feeling of waking everyday feeling like absolute shit. it's unbearable. i could never do anything else, and i had to turn to distractions to keep me alive. going back, i met this person during those times and i had to put up with this not-so-miserable but still undeniably miserable version of me everytime i talk to them. it's a shame that i met them in such a terrible phase of my life cuz they seemed pretty alright. i think the breaking point was when one of my cats just fucking died. that cutie was a menace but i still love her to bits.heh it's as if shit couldnt get any worse, huh? months passed, each having their worst points and that god forsaken year just got worse and worse until i was basically just fucking numb. i couldnt do anything about my other problems cuz i was too busy not fucking up my second sem. during one of those months, i created this site just to have a false sense of accomplishment for myself. just one of my many many many distractions. just to temporarily get away from everything. but hey, no matter how much you cover up and decorate a filth, it'll still reek horribly. while i very much still hate my life, i figured i just had to go on. i cant hurt my mom, my sibs, and even my dad lol. i think it was around september when shit just got fucking worse than it already is. a family issue got revived after painstakingly trying to bury it for years, and fuck my entire life officially is a mistake! my dad said it himself, and theres no doubt he'd erase me and my sibs out of existence if he had the chance to do so! as much as it should sound like great news for my existential questions, it felt fucking awful hearing those from him. heh, who wouldve thought i still kept this little space for him somewhere in my heart. that shit just got broken, obliterated even! not gonna fucking lie, i was at fault for not getting myself ready for this. hes been dropping all kinds of easter eggs since he came back, and that night back in july shouldve told me everything!! whats truly wicked is that he wanted us to hear those even if 'it was intended for my mother and my grandparents' lol. i was left clueless as to how i should proceed but i still managed to stay alive lmao. maybe a huge part of it is because there isnt any reliable suicide methods at where i currently reside, but hey if shit gets worse in the future, when i finally move out at least i could jump from my dormitory's terrace. seriously though, i cant really do that shit cuz my mom believes that things would eventually be okay. a part of me believes her. i admire her for accomplishing so much despite going through lots of shitty stuff. i also am grateful for having these people who unknowingly pushed me forward. if youre reading this right now, im sorry for saying those upsetting things. you really helped me more that you could ever imagine. ive been paralyzed in so much aspects of my life, but i had to limp with my working leg and just do shit and forget all the drama. no pills, no crutches

<br><br>

sometimes i still have those moments, feeling super awful and shit just like right now. still sort of mad at that person for reducing all my experiences and reasons to a single word. it just feels unfair that everyone thinks that i didnt try hard enough when i did every fucking thing just to stay 'sane'. ive wasted my time sleeping for countless hours on end, hoping that i might miraculously forget this pain when i wake up one day. my life just feels so empty and pointless. and it is empty and pointless. i lied to everyone. i had to... no one can stand miserable people, right? in case youre curious, im not gonna kill myself anytime soon regardless of how much my mind itches to just snap out of existence! heh, thanks for reading all that. it gives me solace sort of that im being honest at least once in my life. haha yeah i hope theres one way to put up a sign that says IM MISERABLE AND I HATE MYSELF!! IF WE'RE 'FRIENDS', AM SURE AS HELL THAT I WILL HURT YOU ONE WAY OR ANOTHER BECAUSE IM FUCKING BROKEN. BELIEVE WHEN I SAY THAT I AM TRYING MY BEST. I DONT WANT TO HURT YOU AND I LOVE YOU. IM JUST TOO BROKEN, NEVER ATTEMPT TO FIX ME!! TOTALLY NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. sorry for that. if you cant relate one bit to anything i just said, just please try to be kind to strangers as much as possible. and if you do 'get it', man just hold on to this faith blindly: it'll get better :) love ya!
