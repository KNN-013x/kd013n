                            hi
                            you must be shitting yourself being forced to watch this shitshow. let me get this straight: if anything, youre shown the trailers, the general plot, and weekly sneakpeeks. i wasnt. im blindly following the plot the writers created. i dont have a fucking clue of the overarching story, nor do i have a clear memory of the distant and immediate past. i do not have the plot to this shit. i couldnt make a plot review because id have to do my fucking homework first <br><br>
                            you must be thinking how stupid ive been in the last episodes. now let me just briefly mention how stupid a production team can be to think my life is monetizable. this story isnt the best, and certainly isnt a blockbuster. i mean, they couldve chosen someone with better writing skills, but youre stuck with a mediocre person with an incredibly frustrating personality. as per usual, please dont mind the grammatical errors or preposition misuse. you should be over it by this point already, but i clearly am not!!! <br><br>
                            oh, and you must already be fucking sick and tired of hungarian rhapsody no. 2 arent you? <br><br>
                            yes. i dont fucking know what im doing. you can blame laziness. perhaps it's lust. maybe cowardice. im fucking done with this shit. can we skip to the next episodes? oh yeah, i see you laughing. im stuck here, and i guess i'll just take solace in the fact that we're both witnessing these unfortunate events, albeit in different POVs <br><br>
                            i am sorry for being so frustrating. you, spectators, can just never see or feel or visualize or empathize with everything thats inside me. i wish we can both be purpose oriented so we can deal with plot adjustments and i can act accordingly with how things could be better. but the confines of our spacetime just wont allow it. you are just as much of a prisoner as i am. someday, i hope i could find solace in that <br><br>
                            now, i guess i'll do something i never did in the previous episodes <br>
                            you owe me one

                            those memories are real <br>
                            it was liberating to think about the end <br>
                            lying on a pool of blood and tears <br>
                            pulsating pain <br>
                            slowly transcending to the unknown <br>
